# Resume
I have uploaded my resume, which highlights my Master's in Data Science and key projects, including publishing a National Stock Exchange dataset on Kaggle and performing sentiment analysis on Amazon fashion reviews. These projects demonstrate my ability to handle real-world data, apply advanced analytical techniques, and collaborate with the data science community. I believe my hands-on experience with these projects, along with my technical skills, makes me a strong candidate for the position.
